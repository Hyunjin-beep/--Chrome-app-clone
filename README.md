## 1. About the project

This project named **MY BULLET JOURNAL** is a digital version of my customized offline bullet journal. 
Overal, this project has three pages which are welcoming a user, orgazing their schedule & 24 hours, and timer for work & study.

## 2. Why do I start this project?

For several years, I wrote customized bullet journal. It helped me a lot to organize my schedule. 
However, someday, I thought **what if there is a digital bullet journal that I can customize for convenient**. 
So I started to think about this project and finally I got a blue print of this project.
